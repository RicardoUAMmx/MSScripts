# MSScripts
Microsoft Scripts fro PowerShell: The main idea was downloading wsl vm to be executed from different location. I hope this idea grow up at time.

## Usage

**To run this script you'll need to:**

- Open a Powershell instance and run as administrator.
- Run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`
- Finally: `Set-Location ~\Documents` and then `.\down_wsl.ps1`
